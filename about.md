<!-- cSpell:disable -->

My name is Jacek Galowicz, and i am a freelancer with professional main
interests in **software development** (mainly **C++** and **Haskell**),
**software architecture**, and **continuous integration & deployment** (CI/CD).
Before getting a job in the industry, i graduated with a Master of Science in
Electrical Engineering.

  </a>
</div>

Over the years i got into bigger and bigger production projects and developed
a lot of competence in how projects and their **build systems** should be
structured in order to maximize the developer's control of the overall quality
of the resulting product.
