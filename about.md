title: About
---

My name is Jacek Galowicz, and my professional main interests are programming
(i used to do a lot of C++ and Haskell) and software architecture.
Before getting a job in the industry, i graduated with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering.
Please have a look at my [CV-like front page](http://galowicz.de) for more information about that.

Over the years i got into bigger and bigger production projects and developed
a lot of competence in how projects and their build systems should be structured
in order to maximize the developer's control of the overal quality of the
resulting products.

This is my personal blog, where i aim to write regularly about interesting daily experiences and thoughts with/about programming in C++ both inspired by work and free time projects.
C++ was the programming language i have most experience and expertise with as i
used to work as a developer for operating system stuff that is based on microkernel design principles.
Over the time i founded a
[company that does similar products](https://www.cyberus-technology.de)
and invested more time into the build systems, CIs and test infrastructure
for such products in order to maximize the value of the whole organization.
