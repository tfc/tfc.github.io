title: About
---

My name is Jacek Galowicz, and i am a software engineer.
Before getting a job in the industry, i graduated with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering.
Please have a look at my [CV-like front page](http://galowicz.de) for more information about that.

This is my personal blog, where i aim to write regularly about interesting daily experiences and thoughts with/about programming in C++ both inspired by work and free time projects.
C++ is the programming language i have most experience and expertise with.
It is my main vehicle for striving after elegant, fast, and generic code.
