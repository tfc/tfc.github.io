</div>

My name is Jacek Galowicz.
I am a freelancer with professional main interests in **software development**,
**software architecture**, and **continuous integration & deployment**
(CI/CD, DevOps).

  </a>
</div>

Over the years i got into bigger and bigger production projects and developed
a lot of competence in how projects and their **build systems** should be
structured in order to maximize the developer's control of the overall quality
of the resulting product.
