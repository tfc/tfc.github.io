Software engineering, or generally IT jobs, are highly social because all big 
software projects or products are built by teams of professionals.
When humans work with humans, all kinds of conflict can emerge, and they are 
often not as easy to fix as IT problems, especially in distributed teams with
less offline human interaction.
This article is about [Fritz Riemann's book "Anxiety"](https://amzn.to/3Gl86yK),
which answers the question "What do people fear and how do they cope with it?".

[Link to the Amazon Store Page of the original German version](https://amzn.to/3C87PfQ)

The book was initially published in German in 1961 and since 2022 its 47th 
edition is sold, while its English translation was published in 2009.
Both versions are a bit more than 200 pages.
I have read the German version of the book.
The English version is advertised as a 1:1 translation.

[Fritz Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Riemann_(psychologist)) was
a German psychologist, psychoanalyst, and book author.
In 1946, he co-founded the Institute for psychological research and psychotherapy 
in Munich.
Riemann became an honorary member of the Academy of Psychoanalysis New York.

## Content and Structure

This book is from a psychologist for non-psychologists.
People go to places, found companies, quit their job to apply for new ones, 
build houses, give talks, etc., for reasons.
According to Riemann, people sometimes do these things as a *reaction* to fear.
Especially when people work or live together, all kinds of conflicts emerge
due to differences in their characters.
What appears normal to one might trigger fears in another.
This can especially happen in international teams due to cultural differences 
but for that topic have a look at my 
[book review of "The Culture Map"](https://blog.galowicz.de/2022/12/12/book-review-the-culture-map/).

Fritz Riemann explains his model that I call the "Riemann Model" over the rest
of this article.

### The Model

No model is a silver bullet but knowing in which situations to apply what model
or at least take it as a rough guide often proves useful.
Riemann postulates that there are different 
[Personality Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type)
based on different atomic fears and needs that each individual has.
People's lives are *driven by their fears*, some more than others.
These fears and needs are:

-------------------- ------------------- ----------------------------
Fear                 Need                Experienced as
-------------------- ------------------- ----------------------------
Fear of              Need to be an       loss of self and 
**self-surrender**   **individual**      dependence 

Fear of              Need to be part     isolation and lack of 
**self-realization** of a **group**      emotional security                

Fear or              Need for            finality and lack of 
**necessity**        **change**          freedom           

Fear of              Need for            transience and 
**change**           **continuity**      insecurity                   
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarded as pairs, they form two conflicting poles that can be visualized as
a diagram:

- Emotional distance vs. proximity from/to others
- Change vs. continuity

![The four types of need-driven character according to Riemann ([schulz-von-thun.de](https://www.schulz-von-thun.de/die-modelle/das-riemann-thomann-modell))](/images/books/grundformen-der-angst-schulz-von-thun-diagram.jpg){width=500px}


The book puts some emphasis on explaining the *extremes* of these characters
first.
These are explained in 40-50 pages each, so if the summarized presentation in 
this blog gives the impression that the topic is dealt with like in a magazine 
checklist, then this is due to the abridged presentation.
These explanations seem very pathologic at first glance because the book is not
about mentally sick but healthy people.
The point of this pathological view is that understanding the extremes improves
comprehension of such traits when observing them in real life, although 
of course not in the depicted extremes.
For every character trait, Riemann gives a very rich and detailed overview of 
the trait but also delves into how they deal with love and aggression and gives 
examples of how they experience typical situations in life.
These chapters are explaining it all so well that it hurts to provide only a 
short and simplified explanation here, but that's why one reads whole books 
instead of summaries anyway.
I am pretty sure that everyone will recognize themselves in all chapters to
some degree, but in different severity.
At last, he also explains what situations and events in early life cause the
development towards each pole.
Let's summarize every trait into caricatures to have an overview:

<div class="floating-image-right">
  ![Distance is a shelter](/images/books/grundformen-der-angst-data.webp){width=300px}
</div>

Schizoid Personality (Distance)

: Schizoids want and need to be seen as individuals (have you ever been 
  irritated when someone got your name or gender slightly wrong?).
  They fight for their freedom and independence.
  For that reason, they feel the need to avoid compromise and commitment.
  Keeping enough emotional distance from everyone is on the one hand like a 
  defense mechanism against everything that reduces their freedom and 
  independence.
  Talking about emotions: They don't like them much and see pure cold 
  rationality as a cure - which is a strength and weakness at the same time.
  However, proximity to others is unavoidable, so they end up developing some 
  protective stance that might often look impersonal and cold to others.
  Schizoids often drift into isolation, as this is what they rescue themselves
  into after conflicts with others.
  While behaving how schizoids behave, they can look aggressive from the 
  perspective of others, which might also be intimidating.
  \
  \
  Such shields are a result of their past: They most likely experienced too much 
  pain in dependent relationships in their young years and grew independent to 
  free themselves from it. 
  \
  \
  Typical traits or attributions by others:
  Aggressive, arrogant, cold, isolated, objective, strong self-esteem, 
  task-oriented, criminal, anti-social

<div class="floating-image-right">
  ![Let's be together always, forever](/images/books/grundformen-der-angst-clingy.webp){width=300px}
</div>

Depressed Personality (Proximity)

: "Depressed" people have a deeply embedded wish for affection and emotional 
  proximity to others, literally all the time.
  "I love you because I need you" and "I need you because I love you" are two
  equally true statements for them.
  All distance that Schizoids try to build up, Depressed try to tear down as it 
  feels like loneliness and being forgotten to them.
  To counter their separation anxiety, they build up all kinds of dependency on 
  others, towards which they also form expectations - which they won't explain 
  because they see that as an indicator of not being understood.
  Depressed often end up blaming others for their situation - the obvious way
  to work towards a solution independently triggers their separation anxiety so 
  they "can't".
  They hope that when they lament their problems, someone will help them.
  Most of the time, help is not what they ask for when they keep lamenting about 
  their problems - it's affection in the form of listening and empathy.
  To others, this often looks like 
  [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness),
  self-pity, a lack of direction, and clumsiness.
  \
  \
  Deep inside, depressive parents don't want their children to grow up and 
  become independent because this bears the potential for the distance they 
  fear.
  So they sometimes end up raising spoiled children with a lack of skills to 
  master life on their own, which produces the next generation of depressive 
  humans.
  \
  \
  Typical traits or attributions by others:
  Indecision, Blaming others, insecure, warm, needy, clingy, caring, dependent, 
  subordinate, people-oriented, empathic, envy, resigning, self-hate, 
  depression, suicide


<div class="floating-image-right">
  ![The perfect world is free of surprises](/images/books/grundformen-der-angst-sheldocracy.webp){width=300px}
</div>

Compulsive Personality (Continuity)

: Compulsive characters fear changes and unplanned events.
  They are on a quest for permanence and security.
  For that reason, they enjoy planning ahead everything in meticulous depth,
  to be prepared even for events that may probably never occur.
  Changing plans even in light of changed circumstances is difficult for the
  compulsive.
  Enduring the costly trade-offs of a local optimum is much easier for them than 
  trying a promising new solution because it might introduce new unforeseen 
  problems.
  New ideas are always evaluated in terms of how they help support the Old 
  World.
  The lack of control over life and the future is a burden.
  When compulsive people catch themselves in the act of giving in to temptation 
  or losing control of their emotions in an argument, guilt plagues them for a 
  long time.
  \
  \
  Strict parents instill in their children the need for planning, control, and 
  security by constantly admonishing them about order, punctuality, and 
  compliance from an early age.
  In later life, the ever-admonishing feeling remains in the back of their mind.
  \
  \
  Typical traits or attributions by others:
  Reliable, dutiful, precise, rigid, jealous, fanatic, despotic, pedantic, 
  prejudice, perfectionism, responsible, diligent, tidiness, parsimony


<div class="floating-image-right">
  ![I want everything, now!](/images/books/grundformen-der-angst-princess.webp){width=300px}
</div>

Histrionic Personality (Change)

: Histrionics fear stagnation.
  It does not matter if everything is fine where they are: They want to 
  experience new things, travel to new places, and try out new ideas.
  That the unknown does not always bear good things is irrelevant:
  It's change what they are after, change for its own sake.
  Making no plans helps histrionics to concentrate on the moment, free from the
  obligation to express what goal would be achieved by what they are doing.
  They don't find security at all convincing because they are busy trying to 
  free themselves from rules and compromises.
  In between their chaotic life they are nonetheless very charismatic and 
  charming.
  But don't feel too flattered if they tell you confidential gossip as you're
  one of many listeners providing them attention.
  \
  \
  Milieus that are chaotic, contradictory, incomprehensible, and/or without 
  guidance and healthy models give the child too little orientation and support.
  In such environments, children learn:
  "If they don’t love you enough when you're easy and uncomplicated, then their 
  concern for you will get you there when you're being problematic. 
  The more often sick, the more loved."
  \
  \
  Typical traits or attributions by others:
  Adventurous, impulsive, spirited, attention-seeking, narcissistic, unreliable,
  airs and graces, superficial, manipulable, charming, impatient


### Application

Similar to the question about what *good* criticism or *good* communication
is, as covered in my 
[review of the book The Culture Map](/2022/12/12/book-review-the-culture-map), 
the model highlights what the limits of empathy can look like and where they
originate:
Characters of one side feel like they have the cure for the other.
That is because their fears and feelings are not only very different - they 
never felt each other's emotions the same way in comparable situations like 
this.

From the perspective of the diagram, Riemann's model has a striking similarity
to the [DISC model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment) which is 
more internationally known.
But Riemann's model is not designed to match people with lists of traits to 
classify them in isolation (although you can always analyze your own fears,
use the model to help yourself understand the underlying causes and improve your 
daily interaction with the world at work or in relationships).
Every human has traits from all the presented poles at the same time.
It's the personal weighting of each trait that makes the character.
The Swiss psychologist 
[Christoph Thomann](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Thomann)
extended this model to the Riemann-Thomann model:
The most obvious changes are that he substituted the pathological terms
*schizoid*, *depressed*, *compulsive*, and *histrionic* with the softer terms 
*distance*, *proximity*, *continuity*, and *change* (as already reflected in 
this article).
He also suggests that people might have different positions in the model at work 
than in private life.
This way the model has less of a judging character when used to assess people.
As a couple therapist and later conflict moderator in companies, he 
demonstrated how to use it to arrange people *relative* to each other to
understand their conflict potential.

<div class="floating-image-right">
  ![The tension potential between a proximity and a distance person (source: [Schulz-von-Thun book "Let's Talk"](https://amzn.to/3C9hT8z))](/images/books/grundformen-der-angst-schulz-von-thun-proximity-distance.png){width=400px}
</div>

If you identify someone as more of a proximity-continuity type in comparison
to someone else who is more of a change-distance type, it becomes relatively
simple to foresee the kinds of conflicts they will have with each other at work 
or in their private life.
In a conflict between such a pair, the conflict resolution must begin with 
strengthening the bond for the proximity person, while the distance person first 
needs distance to recover.
This example models a 
[deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock)
that is often easier to solve at work than in romantic relationships.

Another conflict example would be:
What happens if you put one or more distance-change types of persons together
with an existing established team of proximity-continuity types and give them 
the mission to introduce some complex change?
It is not unlikely that the productivity of the group will be reduced while
the team gets stuck in discussions between the people who want a plan for 
everything and the ones who think that you need more of an open experimental 
approach because trying out new things will produce new unforeseeable problems 
where planning doesn't help you much.
Most likely, no one will say "I feel uncomfortable like this, can you please at
least give me something to hold on" but instead non-productively fantasize bad 
intentions or cram out some prejudices.

<div class="floating-image-right">
  ![How a change type explaining his "plan" may look like to a continuity type](/images/books/grundformen-der-angst-change-plan.webp)
</div>

In such cases, the model helps find out why people don't want things and how to 
present each other's positions in a way that doesn't trigger the other side's 
fears.
The more people in the team educated themselves with such models, the less need 
would be for a manager or moderator to solve such crises.

Also, if someone works together with a happy team of relatively homogeneous 
character traits and realizes that he/she is in the opposite corner of the 
Riemann coordinate system than most of the others, then the Riemann model 
provides new ways to explain why such an environment feels exhausting or even 
toxic to them without even anyone having about bad intentions.
In such cases, the model provides some guidance in describing why some team
constellations simply are less efficient or effective than others, and how
to compose teams with what combination of personality types for which kind of 
task.
If all advice fails, the book gives a good decision basis on whether to leave a
constellation.

If you speak in front of a group or sell products or ideas, having some 
knowledge about the character types of the key people in the room will also help
present your subject in the right way by carefully circumnavigating what might
trigger their discomfort.

The Riemann Model is also a useful complement to the 
[Situational Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory)
model for managers:
This model prescribes that leaders should adapt their leadership style to the 
maturity of the people or group they manage.
At the same time, the Riemann Model suggests that the style of interaction with
people and groups should be chosen by their personality traits.
From that perspective, the situational leadership model provides a *temporal* 
view that develops over time, and the Riemann model a *spatial* view that 
considers the needs of the underlying character.

## Summary

Over the years, it kind of became my thing at work to introduce new technologies 
or ways to solve challenges - having a tendency towards the distance and change 
types from the book - this always happened with the best intentions to improve 
my customer's/team's/company's agility, ability to innovate, etc.
Reading this book helped me understand better *why* and how other people 
sometimes see this as a curse or threat instead of a blessing, and how to 
present ideas to reach more people in the intended ways with fewer 
misunderstandings.
Also, while founding my own company together with colleagues, I faced new
challenges in human interaction e.g. by becoming manager of a team, etc.

Most popular science books that originate from psychology or social sciences 
don't contain completely new things:
As an "experienced human" we have seen most situations already.
What such books provide are views on the situations/challenges that are already 
known, with a new structure that helps describe challenges and find better 
solutions.
Not only in that regard I found this book to be a fascinating and inspirational 
read.
To me, reading this book equals never again having no explanation for the
strange behavior of others that have a completely different character.
Such insights don't automatically provide solutions but at least extend limits 
of empathy.

The model provides useful insights but less actionable advice.
For more detailed advisory I suggest reading 
[Nico Fleisch's book about the Riemann-Thomann Model](https://amzn.to/3Q6njH4)
for which I, unfortunately, did not find any English version.

Humans who work with other humans should read this.
