Why do American coworkers always communicate so clearly, but at the same time
critisize only in outlines?
When do Asian coworkers finally say something in meetings?
How do German coworkers get done *anything* innovative in their planning
madness?
After having experienced many strange situations in projects with people from
around the world, i found Erin Meyer's book
[The Culture Map](https://amzn.to/3h7RAZ6) to be so insightful that i would
declare it a must-read for any software developer who works with international
teams.

## Book & Author

The book is originally from 2014, but got its new yellow cover in 2016, which
is still called the first edition.
It presents 8 handy chapters distributed over ~290 pages.

[Erin Meyer](https://erinmeyer.com) is a professor at
[INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/erin-meyer), one of the
world's leading business schools.
After having lived in many parts of the world and having helped global leaders
to manage the complexities of cultural difference, she presents this amazing
book that explains the cultural differences that she studied, in striking
clarity.

## Content and Structure

Erin starts with many different examples which are all very surprising (or not
so if you experienced them yourself already), and at least some of them will
feel very familiar to every reader.

### The Eight Scales

There are plenty of articles out there which discuss the differences between
work cultures and even give great tipps about what to do and not to do in
different cultures at work to not commit a blunder.

What this book really makes different is that it does not simply explain
"Colleagues from country A are like this and colleagues from country B are like
that".
Instead, it categorizes certain traits which are common between all humans, and
puts each work culture in relation to each other on one scale for each trait:

![Cultural Traits on the 8 scales. [source: erinmeyer.com](https://erinmeyer.com/mapping-out-cultural-differences-on-teams/)](/images/books/erin_meyer_multicultural_characteristics_chart.jpg)

Each chapter of the book explains one of the scales.
The advantage of the approach to look at these traits in isolation and then
put them together for each culture, is that each chapter is short,
comprehensible, and easy to memorize.
On top of that, it is relatively simple to assess cultures on this map of scales
that are not treated in this book.

Apart from per-country culture, many companies have developed their own work
culture which may be different from companies in the same country, but can be
explained quickly and efficiently to outsiders.

Let's get to these traits.
I will briefly summarize them and maybe give some highlights, but won't cover
the long list of practicable advise on how to switch sides at work when needed.
Every trait is also presented with a scale that positions each country according
to its culture.

Communicating: Low-Context vs. High-Context

: Different cultures have a different perspective on what *good communication*
  means:

  - Low-Context:
    - Precise, simple, clear.
    - Messages are expressed and understood at face value.
    - Repetition ia appreciated if it helps clarify the communication.
  - High-Context:
    - Sophisticated, nuanced, layered.
    - Messages are both spoken and read between the lines.
    - Messages are often implied but not plainly expressed.

  An interesting perspective covering this scale is that the low-context
  communication style could be taken as an affront to high-context people
  because it can make them feel "This simple and redundant language gives me the
  feeling that they think i am stupid." -- while the other way around might be
  like "This layered language gives me the feeling that i am not trustworthy,
  otherwise they would just speak straight."

  A rule of thumb is that humans from countries with very old history and to
  some extent isolation share a lot of context in their language, giving them
  the possibility to say more with less. People with very different backgrounds
  don't have as much common context, hence the need for more precise
  communication.

Evaluating: Direct Negative Feedback vs. Indirect negative Feedback

: This scale is about different ways to give *negative* feedback:

  - Direct
    - Negative feedback to a colleague is provided frankly, bluntly, honestly.
    - Negative messages stand alone, not softened by positive ones.
    - Absolute descriptors are often used when critisizing.
      (e.g. "totally inappropriate", "completely unprofessional")
    - Critisizm may be given to an individual in front of a *group*.
  - Indirect
    - Negative feedback to a colleague is provided softly, subtly,
      diplomatically.
    - Positive messages are used to wrap negative ones.
    - Qualifying descriptors are often used when critisizing.
      (e.g. "sort of inappropriate", "slightly unprofessional")
    - Critisizm is given only in private

  Especially cultures that are at the same time low-context and
  direct-negative-feedback, like the US and UK, at first sight seem like a
  strange combination, but are well explained in this chapter.

  What is more important when giving *good critisizm*? Making sure that it is
  conveyed in a polite way at the price of maybe being overlooked or not
  understood to full extent -- or conveying it in its clearest form, which also
  conveys a form of trust on the strength of the (work) relation?

Persuading: Principles-First vs. Applications-First

: Here, it is about how new ideas and approaches are explained to an audience:

  - Principles First
    - Individuals have been trained to first develop the theory or complex
      concept before presenting a fact, statement, or opinion.
    - The preference is to begin a message or report by building up a
      theoretical argument before moving on to a conclusion.
    - The conceptual principles underlying each situation are valued.
  - Applications First
    - Individuals are trained to begin with a fact, statement, or opinion and
      later add concepts to back up or explain the conclusion as necessary.
    - The preference is to begin a message or report with an executive summary
      or bullet points.
    - Discussions are approached in a practical, concrete manner.
    - Theoretical or philosophical discussions are avoided in a business
      environment.

  I found this distinction not only to be valid when talking to humans of
  different cultures, but also when talking to professionals of different
  departments.

  This part of the whole model does not clearly apply to asian cultures, for
  which the chapter devotes another subsection.

Leading: Egalitarian vs. Hierarchical

: Different cultures prefer different leading styles:

  - Egalitarian
    - The ideal distance between a boss and a subordinate is low.
    - The best boss is a facilitator among equals.
    - Organizational structures are *flat*.
    - Communication often skips hierarchical lines.
  - Hierarchical
    - The ideal distance between a boss and a subordinate is high.
    - The best boss is a strong director who leads from the front.
    - *Status* is important.
    - Organizational structures are *multilayered and fixed*.
    - Communication follows set hierarchical lines.

  This chapter is especially interesting for the reason that it is easy to
  accidentally someone's feeling of authority by e.g. skipping the hierarchy
  when mailing questions to people etc.
  Also, in hierarchical cultures it may be pointless to ask about peoples'
  opinions in the presence of their boss.
  This chapter is full of examples and advise.

Deciding: Consensual vs. Top-Down

: How are decisions formed in organizations?

  - Consensual: Decisions are made in groups through unanimous agreement.
  - Top-Down: Decisions are made by individuals (usually the boss).

  The principle is straight-forward but the most interesting case are cultures
  which combine strict hierarchy with consensual decision-making.
  The strongest example for this is Japan with its [Ringi-Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_management_culture#Managerial_style), but this is only the strongest
  example of many (Germany also cultivating this mixture).

  My personal highlight of this chapter is the "big D vs. little d" model that
  helps explaining people from cultures that are at opposite ends of this scale,
  what kind of decision is needed or made when.
  When a big-D decision is made, then it is to be seen as strict, while a
  little-d decision allows for flexibility even after the decision was made.
  This distinction is helpful for setting expectations of groups that appear
  chaotic or inflexible to each other.

Trusting: Task-Based vs. Relationship-Based

: How do people build trust?

  - Task-Based
    - Trust is built through business-related activities.
    - Work relationships are built and dropped easily, based on the practicality
      of the situation.
    - "You do good work consistently, you are reliable, i enjoy working with
      you, i trust you."
  - Relationship-Based
    - Trust is built through sharing meals, evening drinks, and visits at the
      coffee machine.
    - Work relationships build up slowly over the long term.
    - "I've seen who you are at a deep level, I've shared personal time with
      you, I know others well who trust you, I trust you."

  I really felt this difference myself while working for american companies that
  also have for example Indian offices.
  Work with the Indian colleagues got much better after getting to know them in
  person, while i basically got to know the american colleagues only at office
  times.
  The book also explains that especially in Asian cultures it can be beneficial
  to be drunk together, because having seen each other with guards down
  increases trust on a personal level.

  Another highlight of this chapter is the "Peach vs. Coconut" principle:
  People from different cultures might misinterpret friendlyness as too much of
  an invitation for personal connection or an offer of friendship, which might
  look "fake" to them.
  In that regard, peach cultures are friendly and soft with people they have
  just met, but the real self stays protected professionally. Coconut cultures
  in contrast present a hard protecting shell at first but an even softer core
  inside (once you are through the shell!).

Disagreeing: Confrontational vs. Avoids Confrontation

: How do colleagues disagree?

  - Controntational
    - Disagreement and debate are positive for the team or organization.
    - Open confrontation is appropriate and will not negatively impact the
      relationship.
  - Avoids Confrontation
    - Disagreement and debate are negative for the team or organization.
    - Open confrontation is inappropriate and will break group harmony or
      negatively impact the relationship.

  Confrontational cultures are also emotionally more expressive, which can be
  overwhelming for people of different cultures -- what looks like a normal
  discussion to one can seem like a fight that is about to break out to another.

  As the styles of disagreeing and decision-making can cause incompatibilities
  especially in big international companies, the chapter explains how to deal
  with this on large scale, and how to present decisions/discussions to a mixed
  audience.

Scheduling: Linear-Time vs. Flexible-Time

: How do cultures approach plans, projects and appointments?

  - Linear Time
    - Project steps are approached in a sequential fashion, completing one task
      before beginning the next.
    - One thing at a time. No interruptions.
    - The focus is on the deadline and sticking to the schedule.
    - Emphasis is on promptness and good organization over flexibility.
  - Flexible Time
    - Project steps are approached in a fluid manner, changing tasks as
      opportunities arise.
    - Many things are dealt with at once and interruptions accepted.
    - The focus is on adaptability, and flexibility is valued over organization.

  Living in Germany, i see cases of planning obsession around me a lot.
  Planning has advantages, but flexibility has advantages, too, and different
  cultures picked their favorite.
  It seems that the political history of countries has had an effect on the
  planning mentality of humans.

  This chapter puts some effort into giving tips how to combine both in
  multicultural companies.

### Aren't Stereotypes Racist?

For some, the book may trigger the question if books like this may propagate
a school of thought that facilitates box-thinking or even racism.
Erin addresses these worries in the introductory chapter:

> After i published an online article on the differences among Asian cultures
> [...], one reader commented, "Speaking of cultural differences leads us to
> stereotype and therefore put individuals in boxes with 'general traits'.
> Instead of talking about culture, it is importnat to judge people as
> individuals, not just products of their environment."

This is indeed a good point, but her answer puts it in a great perspective:

> If you go into every interaction assuming that culture doesn't matter, your
> default mechanism will be to view others through **your own** cultural lens
> and to judge or misjudge them accordintly.

## Summary

As so often with books about culture and psychology, there are no big surprises
in it, or nothing *completely* new.
The value i took out of this book is that it puts everything in a structured
perspective that i would not have come up with myself.
After reading through it, i felt very inspired and empowered on how to deal with
cultural differences next time, and get more out of intercultural collaboration!

Apart from cultural differences, many people within the same (/your) country
show different traits that can be found on the presented scales, too.
It really helps making sense out of behavior that could otherwise be considered
strange.
It is easier to show empathy when you really understand where people are coming
from.

I declare this book a must read for every (not only) software engineer
professional who works internationally.
